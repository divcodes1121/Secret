                        <strong>Dear Person.</strong>
                            <p>
                                I just want to say I know how much u have been handling urself in these past few months. 
                                I know I’ve hurt you, and that’s the last thing I ever wanted to do. 
                                You mean so much to me, and I hate the thought of us being upset with each other. 
                                I never think of being like this but i know the amount of things hamper me in the process of being so. 
                                You deserve everything and this year you will get everything in ur life and
                                be sucessful in your life. 
                            </p>
